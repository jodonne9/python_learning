You can even use some for sophisticated find-replace in Word!)\n",

    "### Using the `re` module\n",

    "    * In regular expression language, `^` means the start of a string and `$` means the end.\n",
    "* `sub` searches for the regular expression and replaces it with the provided replacement expression.\n",
    "* `findall` searches for all matches of the regular expression within the string.\n",
    "* `split` splits a string using any regular expression as a delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this module provides more powerful versions of some simple string operations: for example, we can also split a string or replace a substring using the built-in `split` and `replace` methods â€“ but we can only use them with fixed delimiters or search patterns and replacements. With `re.sub` and `re.split` we can specify variable patterns instead of fixed strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the functions take a regular expression as the first parameter. `match`, `search`, `findall`, and `split` also take the string to be searched as the second parameter â€“ but in the `sub` function this is the third parameter, the second being the replacement string. All the functions also take an keyword parameter which specifies optional flags, which we will discuss shortly.\n",
