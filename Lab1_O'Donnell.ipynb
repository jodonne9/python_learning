    "For this assignment, you'll work with a few of Python's built-in functions before writing your own. You'll also practice writing documentation strings for your functions, which help explain to others (and your future self!) what the function does and how to use it.\n",

    "You'll work with functions in more depth after [Basics of Functions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html) from Python Like You Mean It. For now, this will be a bit of a shakedown assignment for getting (back) into Python. This builds on [PLYMI Module 1](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module1_GettingStartedWithPython/Informal_Intro_Python.html).\n",
